# DeepFakeDetectorPro

**DeepFakeDetectorPro** is a powerful and efficient tool designed to detect deepfake content using both image and audio analysis. The project utilizes advanced deep learning models to detect anomalies in visual and auditory content that may indicate tampering or manipulation.

This repository contains the necessary components to run deepfake detection using pre-trained models for image and audio data, with detailed forensic reporting and blockchain verification.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Detects deepfake videos and images by analyzing pixel-level inconsistencies.
- **Audio Analysis**: Analyzes audio files for any abnormalities or signs of manipulation (audio analysis is under development).
- **Metadata Analysis**: Analyzes file metadata to detect potential signs of tampering.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a confidence score based on the likelihood of deepfake detection.
- **Forensic Reporting**: Generates a detailed forensic report, including blockchain verification hashes for storing results securely.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizes pre-trained deepfake detection models for both vision and audio.

## Installation

To get started with **DeepFakeDetectorPro**, follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- TensorFlow.js (tfjs-node)
- Pre-trained deepfake detection models (vision and audio models)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepFakeDetectorPro.git
cd DeepFakeDetectorPro
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm.

bash
Copiar código
npm install
3. Add Pre-Trained Models
Download the pre-trained models for image and audio detection and place them in the following directories:

./models/deepfake_vision_model/model.json

./models/deepfake_audio_model/model.json

4. Running the Detector
Once everything is set up, you can initialize and run the detector using the following script:

javascript
Copiar código
const DeepFakeDetectorPro = require('./DeepFakeDetectorPro');

async function run() {
    const detector = new DeepFakeDetectorPro();

    // Initialize the detector
    const initialized = await detector.initialize();

    if (!initialized) {
        console.log('Failed to initialize the detector');
        return;
    }

    // Analyze an image
    const imageAnalysis = await detector.analyzeImage('path_to_your_image.jpg');
    console.log('Image Analysis:', imageAnalysis);

    // Analyze an audio file
    const audioAnalysis = await detector.analyzeAudio('path_to_your_audio.wav');
    console.log('Audio Analysis:', audioAnalysis);

    // Generate forensic report
    const forensicReport = detector.generateForensicReport(imageAnalysis);
    console.log('Forensic Report:', forensicReport);
}

run();
Usage
Initialize the Detector: Load the pre-trained models and get the detector ready to process inputs.

Analyze Image: Use the analyzeImage(imagePath) method to analyze images for deepfake content. It returns a result with a confidence score and details of the analysis.

Analyze Audio: Use the analyzeAudio(audioPath) method to analyze audio files for potential deepfake content. The audio analysis functionality is still being developed.

Generate Forensic Report: After analyzing content, generate a forensic report with generateForensicReport() to log analysis results along with blockchain verification.

API Reference
initialize()
Loads the pre-trained models for image and audio analysis.

Returns: Promise<boolean> — True if models are loaded successfully, otherwise false.

analyzeImage(imagePath)
Analyzes an image for deepfake content.

Parameters:

imagePath: The file path of the image to analyze.

Returns: A Promise that resolves with an object containing:

isDeepfake: Boolean indicating if the image is detected as a deepfake.

confidence: Confidence score (float) indicating the likelihood of the image being a deepfake.

analysisDetails: Object containing further analysis details (pixel inconsistency score, metadata analysis).

analyzeAudio(audioPath)
Analyzes an audio file for deepfake content.

Parameters:

audioPath: The file path of the audio to analyze.

Returns: A Promise that resolves with an object containing:

isDeepfake: Boolean indicating if the audio is detected as a deepfake.

confidence: Confidence score (float) indicating the likelihood of the audio being a deepfake.

anomalies: List of detected anomalies (if any).

generateForensicReport(analysisResults)
Generates a forensic report based on the analysis results.

Parameters:

analysisResults: The result of the image or audio analysis.

Returns: An object containing:

timestamp: The timestamp of the report.

verdict: 'FAKE' or 'AUTHENTIC' based on the analysis.

confidenceScore: The confidence score from the analysis.

evidenceDetails: Detailed information about the analysis, including pixel inconsistencies and metadata.

blockchainVerification: A unique hash for blockchain verification.
